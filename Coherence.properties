    The AssemblyPatch is a combination of 4th and 5th Oracle version numbers.
    The 4th number is multiplied by 1000 to allow for unto 3 digits in the 5th number.
    This is the mapping scheme:

    AssemblyPatch = 4th Oracle number * 1000 + 5th Oracle number;

    e.g:
    12.2.1.0.0 (Oracle) ==> 12.2.1.0    (.NET), AssemblyPatch = 0 * 1000 + 0 = 0
    12.2.1.0.1 (Oracle)	==> 12.2.1.1    (.NET), AssemblyPatch = 0 * 1000 + 1 = 1
    12.2.1.1.0 (Oracle)	==> 12.2.1.1000 (.NET), AssemblyPatch = 1 * 1000 + 0 = 1000
    12.2.1.1.1 (Oracle)	==> 12.2.1.1001 (.NET), AssemblyPatch = 1 * 1000 + 1 = 1001
