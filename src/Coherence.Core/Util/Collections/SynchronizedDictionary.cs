    /// Synchronized <b>IDictionary</b> wrapper that uses read/write locks 
    /// to synchronize access to the underlying dictionary.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// This class uses read/write locks to ensure that only a single thread
    /// can modify the underlying dictionary at any given time, while allowing
    /// concurrent reads by multiple threads.
    /// <p/>
    /// While all individual operations exposed by this class are thread-safe,
    /// you may still need to synchronize access to an instance of this class 
    /// if you need to perform multiple operations atomically. 
    /// <p/>
    /// In order to do that, you can do one of the following:
    /// <list type="bullet">
    /// <item>
    /// <b>Lock the <see cref="SyncRoot"/> property.</b> Because the write 
    /// locks used internally also lock <c>SyncRoot</c>, this will prevent 
    /// concurrent modification. However, concurrent read operations will
    /// still be allowed, which means that other threads will be able to see
    /// partial updates. If you need truly atomic multi-operation updates, 
    /// you should use write locks instead.
    /// </item>
    /// <item>
    /// <b>Use read locks.</b> By acquiring a read lock externally, you can 
    /// ensure that no modifications take place while you are reading from the
    /// dictionary. See <see cref="AcquireReadLock()"/> for details.
    /// </item>
    /// <item>
    /// <b>Use write locks.</b> By acquiring a write lock, you can achieve 
    /// complete isolation and fully atomic multi-operation updates, as no 
    /// other thread will be able to either read from or write to the 
    /// dictionary until the write lock is released. See 
    /// <see cref="AcquireWriteLock()"/> for details.
    /// </item>
    /// </list>
    /// <p/>
    /// <b>Note 1:</b> If you attempt to acquire a write lock on a thread that 
    /// holds a read lock, the read lock will be promoted to a write lock as 
    /// soon as all read locks held by other threads are released.
    /// <p/>
    /// <b>Note 2:</b> The enumerator returned by the <see cref="GetEnumerator"/> 
    /// method is  <b>not</b> thread-safe. You should either acquire a read 
    /// lock or lock the <see cref="SyncRoot"/> explicitly if you need to 
    /// enumerate dictionary entries in a thread-safe manner.
    /// <p/>
    /// <b>Note 3:</b> This class has been renamed from SynchronizedHashtable to 
    /// SynchronizedDictionary in Coherence 3.5, to better reflect the fact
    /// that it can be used to wrap any <c>IDictionary</c> implementation.
