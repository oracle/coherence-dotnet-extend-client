    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// The algorithm is based on a gate concept, allowing threads in
    /// <see cref="Enter"/> and out <see cref="Exit"/>, but occasionally
    /// shutting the gate <see cref="Close"/> such that other threads cannot
    /// enter and exit. However, since threads may "be inside", the gate
    /// cannot fully close until they leave <see cref="Exit"/>. Once all
    /// threads are out, the gate is closed, and can be re-opened
    /// <see cref="Open"/> or permanently closed <see cref="Destroy"/>.
    /// <p>
    /// Each call to <b>Enter</b> requires a corresponding call to
    /// <b>Exit</b>. For example, the following would ensure proper clean-up
    /// using a ThreadGate:</p>
    /// <p>
    /// <pre>
    /// gate.Enter();
    /// try
    /// {
    ///     ...
    /// }
    /// finally
    /// {
    ///     gate.Exit();
    /// }
    /// </pre></p>
    /// <p>
    /// Similarly, each call to <b>Close</b> should be matched with a call to
    /// <b>Open</b>, unless the gate is being destroyed:</p>
    /// <p>
    /// <pre>
    /// gate.Close();
    /// try
    /// {
    ///     ...
    /// }
    /// finally
    /// {
    ///     gate.Open();
    /// }
    /// </pre></p>
    /// <p>
    /// or:</p>
    /// <p>
    /// <pre>
    /// gate.Close();
    /// gate.Destroy();
    /// </pre></p>
    /// <p>
    /// The Enter/Exit calls can be nested; the same thread can invoke Enter
    /// multiple times as long as Exit is invoked a corresponding number of
    /// times. The Close/Open calls work in the same manner. Lastly, the
    /// thread that closes the gate may continue to Enter/Exit the gate even
    /// when it is closed since that thread has exclusive control of the
    /// gate.</p>
