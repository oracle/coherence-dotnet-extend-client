This directory contains data files for POF serialization between Java and .net.

The 'Java' subdirectory contains POF-serialized data generated by the Java
PofStreamTests.java.

The 'dotnet' subdirectory contains POF-serialized data generated by the .net
PofStreamTests.cs.


The unit test PofStreamTests.{cs | java} read the opposite data. That is,
the PofStreamTests.java reads from the dotnet data subdirectory and
PofStreamTests.cs reads from the Java data subdirectory.


When adding new data files (or changing the data), you must run
PofStreamTests standalone; it doesn't normally run with the
tests, because it updates files that are stored in p4 and so are read-only.

To add new data files (or change the data):

1) p4 edit and update PofStreamTests.{cs | java}

2) on dotnet:
    - add a new data file to tests/Coherence.Pof.Tests/Coherence.Pof.Tests.csproj
    - run PofStreamTests.cs to tests/Coherence.Pof.Tests/Coherence.Pof.Tests.csproj

3) on Java:
    - run PofStreamTests.java standalone

4) p4 edit data files as needed

5) run the unit tests

6) copy the dotnet generated data file to main/tests/Data/dotnet

7) copy the Java generated data file to main.net/tests/Coherence.Pof.Tests/Java

8) run the unit tests again to verify PofStreamTests can read the newly
generated data.

9) submit whatever you want to keep
